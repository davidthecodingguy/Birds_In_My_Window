# Birds_In_My_Window
A program that gives the user information about birds sighted from my office window, located in the rural community of Annville, KY, USA!
1
Acquire information regarding the bird sightings in my area from an excel or csv file, stored in local memory. Likely using Pandas read_ functions.
Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type.
2
Eliminate unnecessary/confusing information (null values) from the dataset for ease of legibility and maximum clarity. Null values will be replaced by zeroes.
Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to do things like remove 0’s and null values where they don’t belong in your dataset.
3
Acquire information about the most seen birds, least seen birds, seasonal birds, etc.
Write custom functions to
operate on your data.
4
Data visualization to aid in the understanding of the information gathered.
Make 2 basic plots with
matplotlib, seaborn, or any
other kind of visualization
library that you think looks 
Interesting. -OR- Write markdown cells in
Jupyter explaining your
thought process and code.
5
Explanation of information gleaned from the program and subsequent graphical output.
If using some format other than a notebook, make sure your README explains your project.
